What is it?

My web app is made for looking over the difference among
ML alorithms

- 7 algorithms
- How different according to amount of train data set
- The computation speed of algorithms
- For thinking about the Prons & Cons of algorithms


***
How it was made?

- I used the **caret** package for various Machine Learning algorithms
- The machine learning code is below


```r
algName <- modelSet$algorithm[modelSet$name == input$models]
index <- createDataPartition(iris$Species, list = F, p = input$prob / 100)
set.seed(input$seeds)
fit <- train(Species ~ ., method = algName, data = iris[index, ])
result_iris$Predicted <- predict(fit, newdata = iris[, -5])
```
***
Visualization for the result

- I used the **ggvis** package for the visualization
- The code is below


```r
result_iris %>% 
ggvis(~Sepal.Length, ~Petal.Length, 
fill = ~Predicted, opacity := 0.3, 
shape = ~result, 
size := 150) %>% 
layer_points() %>% 
add_legend("fill", title = "Type of the iris") %>% 
add_legend("shape", orient = "left", title = "Predictions")
```
***
The Outcomes

- This app shows 3 outcomes
 1. You can see the plot of the predicted values through the algorithm you selected
 2. You can also see the comparison table of between original and predicted values
 3. You can analyze the result with the confusion matrix
